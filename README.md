# Excel-Coffee-Sales-Analysis

This project is Coffee Sales Analysis using Excel. I have build a dashboard to showcase Total Sales over Time, Sales by Country and Top 5 Customers charts using filters of date, roast type, size of coffee packet purchased and if the person is a loyalty member or not.

I have used Orders, Customers and Products tables to build this dashboard and combined all of them using functions like XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH and IF statements.

I have also performed data gathering, data cleaning, data formatting and built pivot tables and pivot charts to show the analysis and visualizations.
